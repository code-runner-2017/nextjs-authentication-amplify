This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), that uses Amplify and implements Cognito authentication.

This project is a derivative work of this [project](https://github.com/dabit3/next.js-authentication-aws) updated
with the latest version of Next.js (12.1) and Amplify.

The instruction of building and deploying are the same of the original project.
